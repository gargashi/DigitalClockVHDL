# DigitalClockVHDL
Digital Clock with VHDL 
Introduction:
This design is of digital alarm clock that displays time in hours, minutes and seconds. The goal of this design is to implement all of the basic features that one would normally expect to find on a standard digital alarm clock. Features like 24 hour time, alarm setting and time setting functionality.

List of features implemented:
1. Clock setting functionality
2. Alarm time setting functionality
3. Alarm indicating LED

The design has been implemented on a Nexys4 DDR FPGA development board.
